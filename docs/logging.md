Logging can be found in Sumologic (SaaS).  If you don't have access to Sumo, please feel free to open a Cherwell ticket
requesting okta access to it.

Logs are gathered from the container output. The following project was referenced for how to enable the logging container: https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-collector-docker
